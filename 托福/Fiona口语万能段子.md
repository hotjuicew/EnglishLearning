And l am able to finish them all very quickly. But if l study in my dorm, it will be very noisy because some of my roommates might be talking on the phone loudly and some of them might be playing guitar or something.

**Students should take a year off before entering college.**

They had to spend at least 10 hours a day at school attending classes, dealing with homework, preparing for exams and stuff and so they were pretty stressed out.

So l will get distracted and evenfall asleep in these classes.

**A/D: Celebrities such as athletes and singers are good examples for young people**

Well l agree with the statement that celebrities are good examples for young people because most of them will devote themselves to charities like making donations and so young people who like them are more likely to do the same things. For example,last month, there was an earthquake in Sichuan and hundreds of people got injured. When this happened, Jay Chow who is a famous singer in China donated 100 thousand dollars. I'm a big fan of him. So when l saw this news on TV, l also donated some of my pocket money.(95words)

Well l think one way to reduce air pollution is planting trees because trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through a process,known as photosynthesis and so the air will become much cleaner.

So people might have to wear special masks to protect themselves and some people might get sick like getting lung cancer or something like that. Even worse,some people might even die because of this.

Well l think one way to reduce air pollution is planting trees because trees are able to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through a process known as photosynthesis and so the air will become much cleaner.

So the air quality will improve.

So if l could share a house with other people, l could split the rent with others and so l will be able to save some money and the money saved could be used in better places like buying books and stuff.

**15 合作社交踢足球**
**Kids who take part in team sports have better social abilities**
Well, l agree with the statement that kids who play team sports can actually have better social skills. That's because l think these kinds of sports like basketball or football actually involve a lot of interaction and communication. And kids actually play them a lot. So for example, when playing football, kids have to work together to come up with different strategies to win the game. And also, they have to practice making long or short pass to each other and stuff like that. So in this whole process, they will talk with each other a lot and communicate with each other a lot which can actually improve their social skills.
